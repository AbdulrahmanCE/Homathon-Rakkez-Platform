# Homathon-Rakkez-Platform
This Project was built for the Homathon competition in 2020 in Saudi Arabia. The Homathon was about providing solutions for the coronavirus challenging

Provide a solution in the education field. The solution called the "Rakkez Platform". Rakkez is a platform that will help the teachers to control their students in online lecturers. Using AI we can analyze the student behavior while the online lectures. form their webcam and mics. We can measure their emotion and attention. We also provide a dashboard for the teachers and parents and the school to monitoring and measuring the student level and detect their interests. The most important Advantage in Rakkez that all the analyzing process is done in the student machine, so his video and sound will not be shared with anybody

The deep learning model is tensorflow.js you can find it in the end of ./rakkez_web/index.html file 
and the flutter app in ./rakkez_app folder.

To test the js Deep learning model only with out the landing page you can open file called "test_deep_learning_model.html" inside the rakkez_web folder.

To test the python Deep learning model only with out the landing page you can open run called "test_model.py" inside the python_model folder.
For python you need to install tensorflow, pillow and numpy

Thank you
